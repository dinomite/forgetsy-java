# Forgetsy-java

A JVM port of [Forgetsy](https://github.com/cavvia/forgetsy) in Kotlin.

# Kotlin

This library is written in Kotlin and for use from Kotlin.  Kotlin has great Java interopâ€¦but this library makes use of
named arguments which Java doesn't support and likely makes the API as viewed from Java pretty janky.  If you want to
use this from Java provide a PR or just let me know and we can work on it together.
