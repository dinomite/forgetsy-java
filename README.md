# forgetsy-jvm

A JVM port of [Forgetsy](https://github.com/cavvia/forgetsy) in Kotlin.  Heavy lifting (and persistence, if you care
about that) is done by Redis, so you'll need one of those.

# Synopsis

```kotlin
...
jedisPool = JedisPool(redisHost, redisPort)

val followsData = Delta(jedisPool, name, 7.days(), true)

followsData.increment("UserFoo", date = 14.daysAgo())
followsData.increment("UserBar", date = 10.daysAgo())
followsData.increment("UserBar", date = 7.daysAgo())
followsData.increment("UserFoo", date = 1.daysAgo())
followsData.increment("UserFoo")

println(followsData.fetch())
```

Outputs:

```{UserFoo=0.6666666666666666, UserBar=0.5}```

# Kotlin

This library is written in Kotlin and I use it from Kotlin.  Kotlin has great Java interopâ€¦but this library makes use of
named arguments which Java doesn't support and likely makes the API as viewed from Java pretty janky.  If you want to
use this from Java provide a PR or just let me know and we can work on it together.
